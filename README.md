Inspired by Dave McFarland's work at: https://teamtreehouse.com/library/a-closer-look-at-loop-conditions

This program does the following:
1) Generates a random number from 1 to 10,000
2) Prompts the computer to guess a random number from 1 to 10,000
3) Repeats the loop as many times as necessary until computer's guess matches the Randomly Generated Number (RGN)
4) Prints to the screen (for the user) how many times the computer had to guess to hit the RGN
